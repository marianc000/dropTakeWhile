first element of this stream, and
the element immediately
following the last element of the sequence does
not match the
given predicate.
If this stream is unordered, and some (but not all) elements of
this
stream match the given predicate, then the behavior of
this operation is
nondeterministic; it is free to take any subset
of matching elements
(which includes the empty set).
Independent of whether this stream is ordered or unordered if
all
elements of this stream match the given predicate then this
operation
takes all elements (the result is the same as the
input), or if no
elements of the stream match the given
predicate then no elements are
taken (the result is an empty
stream).
